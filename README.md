# AAU-SpaceRob-AutoDrone
This repository contains the code for Robotics Group 465 at AAU. The project was developed in collaboration with AAU Space Robotics and serves as a foundation for further development in preparation for the upcoming ERC competition.

### HARDWARE:
- Unknown Carbon Fiber Drone Kit (V-shape)
- Motors: Air 2213 kv920 with props.
- Speed Controllers: Unknown
- DC-to-DC Converter: UBEC 5A HV
- Battery: Turnigy 4-cell battery, 4000 mAh - LIPO
- Onboard Computer: Jetson Nano

### SOFTWARE:
- Operating System: Jetson Nano Ubuntu 20.04 image
- ROS2 Distribution: FOXY - Developed our own package.

To get started, download the image from the link provided onto a microSD card (64 GB recommended for flight data logging). Use a tool like BalenaEtcher to flash the image onto the microSD card. Hereâ€™s the link: https://github.com/Qengineering/Jetson-Nano-Ubuntu-20-image


# Guide
Written 04-2024.

This guide is for the Jetson Nano - Ubuntu 20.04 image. The goal of this project is to control a drone autonomously with an onboard computer, such that it can compete in the ERC competetion.
 
Flash the image and boot the Jetson Nano. Password: Jetson.

Start by fixing keyboard language if needed. And other user settings.

## 1. Fix the partition of the drive.
Check if the drive only have part of its storage allocated. In our case only 26 GB was partioned.

Run in terminal:
	
	df -h

If expected valus are returned skip this part. Else run the following command:
 
 	sudo apt-get install gparted
	
Resize current partion until it is taking up as much of the available space as possible. Check again with:
	
	df -h
	
## 2. Check CMake version. 
It is imperative the CMake version is updated to the newest available version for our setup. Else there will be problems installing ROS2.

Link: 
	
 	https://askubuntu.com/questions/355565/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-cmake-from-the-command-line
	
Run:
	
 	CMake --version
	
We want CMake 3.20 or later. If it is newer than this version, you can skip section 2.
 	
Run:
 
 	sudo apt purge --autoremove cmake
 	sudo apt update && \
	sudo apt install -y software-properties-common lsb-release && \
	sudo apt clean all
 
	sudo apt upgrade
 	
 	wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc 2>/dev/null | gpg --dearmor - | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kitware.gpg >/dev/null
 	
 	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install kitware-archive-keyring
	sudo rm /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kitware.gpg
	
Run "Sudo apt update" again to see if it worked. If kitware provides any key errors, you must fix it. (I had one, but fixed it by flashing new os).
	
	Sudo apt update
 
	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6AF7F09730B3F0A4
	
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install cmake
	
	Finish by checking you new version with "cmake --version". I had cmake --version

## 3. Install ROS2
If the ROS2 installation guide in the following link does not work. Use ours based on second link.

Installation guide:

	https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html

Key issue fix:

 	https://answers.ros.org/question/398460/how-to-add-a-pubkey/

Run:
	
 	locale

If UTF-8, continue.
		
Run:
	
 	sudo apt install software-properties-common
	sudo add-apt-repository universe
		
If it returned expected results, then continue.
	
Run:
	
	sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
	sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
	echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade
	
If it returned expected results, then continue.
	

Install ROS2 FOXY with desktop:
	
 	sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop python3-argcomplete
	sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
		
Install colcon (should be installed with ros-dev-tools):
	
	sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
	
If it returned expected results, then continue. 
	
Install Python dependencies:
	
	pip install --user -U empy==3.3.4 pyros-genmsg setuptools

 You should now have working ROS2 Distrubution on the onboard computer. 
 
## 4. Build a ROS2 workspace on the Onboard computer.
Clone the repository to the onboard computer. We used github-desktop, and placed it in the home path contrary to the normal location in the documents folder. This was done to make it more accessible trough the terminal.

Open a terminal on the onboard computer, and navigate the location of the workspace. Use the following command to build it. This must be done every time a modification is made to it.

	colcon build

For simplicity you should also make your terminal echo these commands at startup:

	echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
	echo "sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyTHS1" >> ~/.bashrc 
 	
In the drone package, there are five things to look out for when you want to modify it yourself: the scripts, msg, and src folders, as well as the CMakeLists.txt and package.xml files.

The setup is as follows:

- The ***scripts*** folder contains Python files.
- The ***src*** folder contains C++ files.
- The ***msg*** folder contains message definitions.
- The ***CMakeLists.txt*** file contains the build commands.
- Lastly, the ***package.xml*** contain package dependencies.

To use python or cpp files you make yourself add their path to the CMakeLists.txt - specifically under the install(PROGRAMS ... DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})

	install(PROGRAMS
 	 scripts/example.py
  	 src/example.cpp
 	 DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
	)

## 5. Assemble drone, setup the FC and the onboard computer.
Using QGroundControl download the latest firmware to your board. Change the following setting and calibrate it.

Settings to be modified:
- ARMING_CHECK : 0
- BRD_SAFETY_DEFLT : 0
- SERIAL1_BUAD : 57600
- SERIAL1_OPTIONS : 0
- SERIAL1_PROTOCOL : MAVLink2

We also disabled the magnetometer, in the calibrations tab.

Assemble the drone - This includes:
- Mount Battery
	- Make sure that a power module is connected, such that power can be distrubuted to the FC 
- Mount the FC
	- Supply it with power from the power module
	- Connect Buzzer
- Mount the Jetson Nano
	- Supply it with power from the DC-DC converter
- Make sure the wires from the motors are placed in the FC in the ***correct order***. Follow the guide in the usermanual of the radionlink FC
- Connect Telem1 or Telem2 to the Nano
	- FC_RX (PIN 3 from the left) : Nano_TX (pin ***8***)
 	- FC_TX (PIN 2 from the left): Nano_RX (pin ***10***)
   	- FC_GND (PIN 6 from the left): Nano_GND (pin ***9***)

Now calibrate the sensors on the drone. After a calibration is made, the drone should be ready for liftoff!

## 6. Test out your hardware

Nice to have commands:<br>
Disable firewall:<br>
sudo ufw disable<br>

source ro2<br>
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash<br>

Source install<br>
source install/local_setup.bash<br>

###create a bash script
\`\`\`bash
nano ~/.bashrc
\`\`\`
\`\`\`bash
fc() {
    cd /home/nejmann/Documents/GitHub/P4_DroneProject || {
        echo "Failed to navigate to /home/nejmann/Documents/GitHub/P4_DroneProj>
        return 1
    }
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    source install/local_setup.bash
    echo "Commands executed successfully."
}
\`\`\`
